# Solodev Managed Kubernetes for EKS..
This Quick Start helps you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster that uses Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), enabling you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications running on Kubernetes on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

## Overview
Solodev Managed Kubernetes for EKS uses a set of YAML templates to create a new EKS cluster. All YAML templates are deployed via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">AWS CloudFormation</a>.
